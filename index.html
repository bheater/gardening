    <h2>Garden Design</h2>
    <p>There are three fundamental factors to consider in any garden:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Location</li>
      <li>Climate</li>
      <li>Light</li>
      <li>Style</li>
      <li>Space</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. Location</h3>
      <p>Where will your garden be located?</p>
      <p>A garden is traditionally located in the frontyard, backyard, patio, or
         deck. Indoor plants have also been gaining popularity. My garden
         resides on a covered deck and revieves ample indirect
         sunlight all day. Most gardens will be outside, but climate and shade
         will vary, depending on your geographic location and orientation to the
         sun.</p>
    <h3>2. Climate</h3>
    <p>Climate is the most important factor to ensure the longevity of your
      plants and the success of your garden. Choose plants known to thrive
      within your USDA Hardiness Zone.</p>
    <p>The USDA Hardiness Zone Map divides North America into climate zones to
       better inform which types of plants will grow well in your area.</p>

      <p>Check out the <a href="https://garden.org/nga/zipzone/">USDA Hardiness Zone Finder</a> to input your zip code and
        find the Hardiness Zone for your garden. Select plants categorized
        within your climate zone. </p>
    <h3>3. Light</h3>
      <p>How many hours of direct sunlight is your garden is exposed to? </p>
      <p>Sunlight is the next, most important aspect of properly planning plants
         for your garden.</p>
      <ul>
        <table cellspacing="10">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Exposure</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Full sun</td>
              <td>At least 6 hours of direct sunlight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Partial sun or partial shade</td>
              <td>3-6 hours of direct sunlight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Shade</td>
              <td>Less than 3 hours of direct sunlight <q cite="https://getbusygardening.com/how-to-determine-sun-exposure/">with the bulk of the sun exposure occurring during either early morning, late afternoon, or dappled sunlight (filtered) throughout the day.</q></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </ul>
    <h3>4. Style</h3>
    <p>How do you want your garden to look and feel?</p>
    <p>The key to determine the right style of a garden is to determine
      how the garden should make you feel. If I want to feel relaxed, I might
      design the garden with lush, exotic, tropical trees and pinapple to remind
      me of vacations to Hawaii and the Bahamas. Succulents and cacti from
      Arizona remind me of friends and the beauty of the desert. Incorporating a
      myriad of plants in a uniform style (i.e. terra cotta pot) can be create an
      aestheically pleasing harmony that evokes wonderful memories.
    <p>What aesthetic or theme will your garden embue?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modern and minimalist</li>
      <li>Regal, stately, and traditional</li>
      <li>Rustic and cottage-esque</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Space</h3>
    <p>How large will your garden be?</p>
    <p>The location and size of your garden will determine if any plant stands
    or planters will be neccessary. For instance, plant stands and planters are
    especially helpful when creating a garden on a patio or deck. The style you
    determined in the previous section can help inform which designs to choose.</p>
